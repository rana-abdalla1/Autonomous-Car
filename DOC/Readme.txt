About my project:

An autonomous car made using ATMEGA32, Servo motor, 2 DC motors attached to wheels, Ultrasonic sensor attached to the servo motor.
The sensor detects if an obstacle is within 20cm, the DC motors then stop. The servo motor is activated and turns the sensor 90 degrees to the right,
then the sensor measures the distance to the right, after this the servo rotates the sensor 90 degrees to the left to measure the distance to the left.
Then depending on which distance was larger the car moves in that direction.
